abstract: This paper analyses the impact of trade policies that seek to improve domestic production on welfare. I estimate how an ad-valorem tariff over handset components introduced by the Indian Government affects a firm's decision over price, production location, and product set. The preliminary estimates suggest that the analyzed trade policy introduced succeeds in motivating firms to switch to local production. As a consequence of this, prices increase, and the number of available products decreases. In combination with a decrease in some firms' profits, the introduction of the policy diminishes total welfare.
